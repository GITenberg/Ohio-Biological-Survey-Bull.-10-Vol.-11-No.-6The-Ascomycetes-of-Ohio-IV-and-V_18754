<h3>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>


<p>It was stated in the second paper of this series that the disposition of
the <i>Lecideaceae</i> in an early paper of the series would show what slight
changes are needed in treating lichens as we treat other ascomycetes. It
is hoped that this paper has accomplished this in phraseology
intelligible to those acquainted with the present-day language of
systematic mycology.</p>

<p>The <i>Lecideaceae</i> form a well-defined family of lichens, the affinities
of which seem plainly marked. In apothecial structure, and so far as
known, in structure of the sexual reproductive areas, the family seems
to be closely related to the mainly non-lichen <i>Patellariaceae</i> and to
such lichens as the <i>Gyalectaceae</i>, the <i>Lecanactidaceae</i>, the
<i>Collemaceae</i>, the <i>Baeomycetaceae</i>, and the <i>Cladoniaceae</i>.</p>

<p>Following the commonly-accepted theory that the lichens have been
evolved from non-algicolous fungi, the origin of the <i>Lecideaceae</i> and
related lichens from <i>Patellaria</i>-like ancestors is a reasonable
supposition, though the relative rank of the various related families
named in the last paragraph is not easy to decide. Within the
<i>Lecideaceae</i>, the line of evolution seems to have been in the direction
of a well-developed exciple and from simpler to more complex spores.
With the advance in these two directions has gone a slightly increased
development of the thallus.</p>

<p>In structure, the thallus is crustose, and the thalli vary from
inconspicuous, evanescent conditions to those which are conspicuous and
sometimes even subsquamulous. Rarely the thallus extends upward as a
veil which surrounds the apothecia laterally and suggests how the
thalloid exciple of higher families probably arose. As usual in crustose
forms, the thalli are composed of hyphae which are densely disposed
toward the upper, exposed surface and more loosely disposed toward the
lower surface (<a href="#pl13fig02">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>The apothecial evolution passes from forms with weak, light-colored
exciples and soft texture (<a href="#pl13fig10">Fig. 10</a>) to those with strong, dark exciples,
which are firm in texture (<a href="#pl13fig11">Fig. 11</a>). The superficial apothecial
characters are so much alike in many of the species that one cannot
always feel certain even of the genus of unfamiliar forms until he has
studied them microscopically.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>The paraphyses are commonly distinct in young apothecia, but in mature
apothecia they are usually more or less gelatinized and coherent. In
some of the species, they become so gelatinized that they form a
homogeneous mass about the asci, in which the individual paraphyses are
no longer discernible. When distinct, the paraphyses are sometimes
branched, most commonly toward their apices (<a href="#pl13fig01">Fig. 1</a> and <a href="#pl13fig12">12</a>).</p>

<p>There is great diversity with respect to spore development, the whole
range of spore structure, from minute, simple, hyaline spores to those
which are large, brown, and muriform being found within the family
(Figs. <a href="#pl13fig03">3</a>, <a href="#pl13fig04">4</a>, <a href="#pl13fig05">5</a>, <a href="#pl13fig06">6</a>, <a href="#pl13fig07">7</a>, <a href="#pl13fig08">8</a>, <a href="#pl13fig09">9</a>, and <a href="#pl13fig13">13</a>). This condition makes it appear
quite possible that the family may be polygenetic.</p>

<p>The genus, <i>Biatorella</i>, contains non-lichen forms and is probably as a
whole more closely related to the <i>Patellariaceae</i> than to the
<i>Lecidiaceae</i>. However, our two species, both of which are lichens, are
herein admitted to the latter family. Through one or more species with
larger spores than are usually found in this genus, <i>Biatorella</i>
approaches <i>Lecidea</i>. Starting with <i>Lecidea</i>, we have a natural series
in spore development with intermediate conditions difficult to place.
The series runs thus: <i>Lecidea</i> with simple hyaline spores (<a href="#pl13fig03">Fig. 3</a>);
<i>Biatorina</i> with two-celled, hyaline spores (<a href="#pl13fig04">Fig. 4</a>); <i>Bilimbia</i> with
several-celled, hyaline spores, not much narrowed (<a href="#pl13fig05">Fig. 5</a>); and
<i>Bacidia</i> with several-celled, hyaline, acicular spores (<a href="#pl13fig06">Fig. 6</a>).
<i>Buellia</i> and <i>Rhizocarpon</i> are aberrant genera, brown-spored, and
closely related among themselves (Figs. <a href="#pl13fig08">8</a>, <a href="#pl13fig09">9</a>, and <a href="#pl13fig13">13</a>). Through
<i>Buellia</i>, the two genera are related to <i>Rinodina</i> of the
<i>Physciaceae</i>. The two aberrant genera are like other members of the
<i>Lecideaceae</i> with respect to thallus development and general apothecial
characters, the aberrancy being with respect to the spores, on which
account the two genera are placed in another family, the <i>Buelliaceae</i>,
by some workers, perhaps with sufficient reason.</p>

<p>The algal host is <i>Pleurococcus</i>-like (<a href="#pl13fig02">Fig. 2</a>, c) in nearly all species
of the <i>Lecideaceae</i>; but the host cells are so hypertrophied and
distorted that their generic rank is often difficult to ascertain,
except by cultivation outside of the lichen thallus. The algal-host
cells are few in number in some of the species and are sometimes absent
during a portion of the life history of the lichen. The host is usually
found throughout the superficial portions of the thallus, except near
the upper surface, from which portion the algae are usually absent,
except in a dead or dying condition, difficult to detect.</p>

<p>The writer has collected the <i>Lecideaceae</i>, with other fungi, in Butler
County for fifteen years, and has worked for the Ohio Biological Survey
in Preble, Warren, Highland, Fairfield, Adams, Hocking, and Lake
counties. Besides these collections made by the writer, a few specimens
were examined from Champaign, Hamilton, Wayne, Morgan, Madison,
Muskingum, Franklin, Vinton, and Summit counties. Of the 37 species
treated in this paper, 24 had not been reported from Ohio previously.</p>

<h3><i>Systematic Account.</i></h3>

<h2>LECIDEACEAE</h2>


<p>Thallus crustose, without plectenchymatous cortex (<a href="#pl13fig02">Fig. 2</a>, a), varying
from granulose and often evanescent to conspicuous, areolate, or even
subsquamulose conditions, attached to the substratum by hyphal rhizoids
(<a href="#pl13fig02">Fig. 2</a>, d), and in a few instances extending up as a veil and
surrounding the apothecia laterally, the hyphae densely interwoven
toward the upper surface, but more loosely disposed below (<a href="#pl13fig02">Fig. 2</a>, a and
b); apothecia usually minute or small, commonly rounded, the exciple
weak and obscure (<a href="#pl13fig10">Fig. 10</a>, d), or more strongly developed when
conspicuous and much darker in color (<a href="#pl13fig11">Fig. 11</a>, b); hypothecium varying
from hyaline to dark brown (<a href="#pl13fig10">Fig. 10</a>, b and <a href="#pl13fig11">Fig. 11</a>, c); hymenium almost
always lighter and commonly hyaline (Figs. <a href="#pl13fig10">10</a> and <a href="#pl13fig11">11</a>, a); paraphyses
usually simple, but branched forms to be found frequently (Figs. <a href="#pl13fig01">1</a> and
<a href="#pl13fig12">12</a>), pale throughout or darkened toward the sometimes enlarged apex,
commonly more or less coherent and indistinct at maturity; spores simple
and hyaline to muriform and brown (Figs. <a href="#pl13fig02">2</a>, <a href="#pl13fig03">3</a>, <a href="#pl13fig04">4</a>, <a href="#pl13fig05">5</a>, <a href="#pl13fig06">6</a>, <a href="#pl13fig07">7</a>, <a href="#pl13fig08">8</a>, <a href="#pl13fig09">9</a>, and

<h3>THE ASCOMYCETES OF OHIO V<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></h3>


<h2>The Peltigeraceae.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Leafy J. Corrington.</span></h4>


<p>Two genera, <i>Peltigera</i> and <i>Nephroma</i>, constitute the <i>Peltigeraceae</i>
as represented in the flora of Ohio. The thallus is plainly foliose with
the margins of the lobes usually ascending and is gray-green to brown in
color. The lower surface is often conspicuously veined. There are two
pronounced distinctions between the two genera. <i>Peltigera</i> has a
well-developed cortex on the upper side of the thallus only (<a href="#pl14fig01">Fig. 1</a>),
while in <i>Nephroma</i> there is a well-developed cortex on both upper and
lower sides (<a href="#pl14fig02">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>The position of the apothecia constitutes another distinction. In both
genera the apothecia are marginal or submarginal on the lobes, which are
usually narrow and somewhat extended; but in <i>Peltigera</i> they are
immersed in the upper surface, while in <i>Nephroma</i> they are imbedded in
the lower surface.</p>

<p><i>Peltigera</i> furnishes seven species for Ohio, while only one species of
<i>Nephroma</i> has thus far been found in the State.</p>

<p>The algal hosts are usually <i>Dactylococcus</i> or <i>Polycoccus</i>, and both
hosts are sometimes found in the same thallus. The chains of cells are
usually badly broken up, and the nature of the algal host is, therefore,
difficult to distinguish. Other algae doubtless sometimes occur in the
thalli of <i>Peltigerae</i>.</p>

<p><i>Nephroma</i> with cortex on both sides, is to be regarded higher than
<i>Peltigera</i>, which has the cortex on the upper side only. The family is
most closely related to the <i>Stictaceae</i>, from which family it is kept
distinct on account of the absence of cyphellae and the difference in
disposition of the apothecia.</p>

<p>The collecting on which this paper is based was partly by Bruce Fink in
connection with general collecting of fungi in Butler County and in
collecting in Adams, Warren, Fairfield, Preble, Ross, Highland, and Lake
counties for the Ohio Biological Survey. However, a considerable amount
of material found by other collectors and previously reported from Ohio
was examined. Hence, the collecting for the Ohio Biological Survey added
little to knowledge of the <i>Peltigeraceae</i> of Ohio, except in way of
addition to distribution in the State.</p>

<p>Thallus foliose, usually adnate toward the center, with the lobes more
or less ascending at the margins, green-gray varying toward brown, the
upper surface sometimes bare, or again clothed with trichomatic hyphae,
giving it a downy appearance, or bearing cephalodia or isidioid
branchlets, the lower surface usually conspicuously veined, with tufted
rhizoids descending from the veins, color of these light or dark; cross
section showing two distinct layers, the upper plectenchymatous cortex
composed of 2 to 4 layers of meshes, and the medulla, composed of
densely interwoven and irregularly disposed hyphae; lower cortex
lacking, but the hyphae of the lower portion in some instances more or
less horizontally arranged and produced into hyphal rhizoids, thus
serving for support and protection much like a true plectenchymatous
cortex; apothecia usually orbicular, frequently revolute, imbedded in
the upper surface of the lobes; exciple plectenchymatous (<a href="#pl14fig04">Fig. 4</a>);
hypothecium of interwoven hyphae, usually tinged brown; hymenium
commonly pale below and brown above; paraphyses usually simple, but some
branched ones present in all of the species, hyaline in the main, but
usually enlarged and tinged brown at the apex; asci usually
cylindrico-clavate; spores hyaline, fusiform to acicular, sometimes
curved, 4 to 8-celled, 8 arranged parallel in the asci.</p>

<p>The algal host cells lie in the medulla, just below the upper cortex.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
